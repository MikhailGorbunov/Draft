A full stack React Native mobile application (Android) that allows users to install it on an Android phone, be able to search for a cocktail recipe, leave a comment, and (as an extension) personalise the experience . We will use Firebase database to store the recipe and user data.

<!-- restaurant bookings through their unique profile. They can browse restaurant availability, create/review/delete bookings, as well as adding restaurants to their favourites. The backend is built in Java with Spring. -->

## Idea

Every day the human body needs food and water. Therefore, people either cook or order food online. To cook, you need to find food recipes make a shopping list, and tick each item in the list while shopping. You can use pen and paper but it's not environmentally friendly. You can type in your phone's notes but it takes some effort. That's the time when users load an app. And for food recipes, there are plenty of apps. But what about cocktails?

## Brief
Our initial brief was extremely ambitious, so as our team. Together through learning from scratch react native liblary and firebase database we have managed in two weeks time to accomplish the following tasks (shown bellow)

**MVP**


- [x] Display recipes (with images)
- [x] Be able to search cocktail recipe by name
- [x] Data is stored in a database accessible through a RESTful API
- [x] Have a README file with screenshots/videos and running instructions.

<!-- API find or make -->

**Extensions **

Some of the features currently in progress:

- [x] Be able to leave a comment under each recipe
- [x] Have a two colour scheme being both accessible (dark and light)
- [x] Comments have tags 
- [x] Recipe can be searched by the tag
- [x] Be able to search cocktail recipe by ingredient
- [x] Calculate recipe portion 
- [x] Be able to login 
- [x] Be able to add recipe to a shopping list
- [ ] Be able to customize recipe

**Super Extensions **

- [x] Add a cloud (Firebase)
- [ ] Create a shopping bot 
- [ ] Be able to add recipe to a party planner 
- [ ] Create an email invitation
- [ ] Be able to make their own recipe 
- [ ] To be able to upload the app to google play

## Challenges

Here are some of the things we've found difficult:

* Learning a new framework while planning & building 
* Learning how Reactive Native works
* Making our database connect with our mobile app
* File structuring & naming conventions as the project scaled up in size
* Managing dependency and version issues

## Installation

Note: This setup tutorial assumes that you already have installed a package manager like npm and the version control system git.
**From Terminal:**

<b> The installation section of the README is currently under construction. </b>
